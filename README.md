# In this data science project, I focused on predicting monthly revenue for a restaurant business using a RandomForestRegressor model. The dataset included various factors like customer count, menu prices, marketing spend, cuisine type, promotions, and customer reviews. To boost the model's accuracy, I carefully preprocessed the data, selecting features strongly correlated with monthly revenue, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. This project emphasizes the importance of refining models and exploring additional features for improved accuracy in predicting restaurant revenue.
